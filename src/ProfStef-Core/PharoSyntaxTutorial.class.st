title: 'Basic types: Array'
lesson:
'"Pharo supports arrays (sequences of objects). Arrays can be created in different ways: 
- Sending the nessage new: to the class Array, 
- Using the literal syntax #(1 2 3), and 
- Using the dynamic syntax { 1 . 2 . 3 }

Here we look at literal arrays.
Literal arrays are created at parse time and are read-only.
They can only contain literal objects (objects created by the parser, it means without messages)"

A symbol starts with # sign and followed by characters.

For example, there is one and only one Symbol #ProfStef. Even here #ProfStef #ProfStef refer to the same unique symbol whose representation is ''ProfStef''. 

There may be several ''ProfStef'' String objects.

The message == returns true if the two objects are the SAME object.

Try the following expression: "

''ProfStef'' asSymbol

#ProfStef asString

"The following expressions returns different results. Do you guess why?"

(2 asString) == (2 asString)

(2 asString asSymbol) == (2 asString asSymbol)

"This is because the message asString returns a new string. So the first expression checks that two different strings are the same objects: clearly this is false.  

The message asSymbol turn the receiver in an unique symbol (the same if already exists).
So the second expression creates new strings but turns these strings into a unique symbol
using the message asSymbol. Then it compares the symbols are they refer to exactly the same object so the results is true."
